# LED-BLINKING
LED Forward &amp; Reverse Blinking using Arduino UNO (Proteus) This project simulates 8 LEDs blinking in forward and reverse order using Arduino UNO in Proteus software. LEDs connected to pins 2–9 are controlled manually with digitalWrite() and delay(), without using any loop statements, making it simple and beginner-friendly.
